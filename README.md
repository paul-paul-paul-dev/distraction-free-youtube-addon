# Distraction Free Youtube (Chrome Extension)

Based on the [DF Tube (Distraction Free for YouTubeâ„¢)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna) addon.

You can only change the options in the code, because I removed all the checkboxes to change them dynamically. 
Change them to your liking (``` df_youtube.js >>> get_default_options() ```).

This is not an official chrome extension.

If you want to use it, you have to add it to chrome via developer mode.

I do not own any of the images or code.

The chrome extension, which this code is based on, is not being maintained anymore.
